***Localized Command References***

Here you'll find localized versions of the URL command reference (so called 'cheatsheet').  
A printer-friendly PDF-version is linked at the bottom of each page.  
  
For a comprehensive description (at this time german language only) go to

The language-versions which aren't yet translated are displayed in English. If you are a native speaker of that specific language or know someone who could help us with the translation, please feel free to create a pull request or use the 'empty' files "translation-template_command_ref.md" and "translation-template_command_ref.odt" to create the specific translated files and send them via email.  
  
**Thanks for your support!**
