The language-versions which aren't yet translated are displayed in English. If you are a native speaker of that specific language or know someone, who could help us with the translation, please feel free to use the files "cheatsheet_URL-commands_multilanguage.md" and "cheatsheet_URL-commands_multilanguage.odt" to create the specific translated files and send it to adapter(Ã¤t)quantentunnel.de  
Thanks for your support!
