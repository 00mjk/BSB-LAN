BSB Boiler-System-Bus LAN Interface based on Arduino Mega 2560 for Elco Thision, Brötje and similar heating systems

This hardware/software combination should in principle work with all BSB-based heating systems and has been tested in real life with the following heating systems:

- Elco Straton (oil-fuelled heating system)
- Elco Thision S (gas-fuelled heating system)
- Brötje ISR-ZR1 Solar- und Systemregler
- Brötje WBS 22E (gas-fuelled heating system)
- Brötje WGB S 17/20 E EcoTherm Plus
- Brötje NovoCondens SOB 22C / 26C (oil-fuelled heating system)
- Brötje NovoCondens BOB 20

Instructions on how to configure etc. can be found in the README ![here](https://github.com/fredlcore/bsb_lan/blob/master/BSB_lan/BSB_lan).
The forum thread that led to the development of this interface can be found ![here](http://forum.fhem.de/index.php?topic=29762.new;topicseen#new)(Forum is in German, but several members speak English)

Some interface kits from a collective order are still available, fitting directly on the Arduino Mega 2560. Contact bsb (ät) code-it.de if you are interested.
